\section{The BBC detector}
The BBC detector provides information about the centrality and time of the collision.
Each arm (south and north) read from 64 photomultiplier tubes with both charge and time ifnormation.
The procedure for calibration of the signal is equal since RunXX and it is documented somewhere else \cite{A}.
Here we investigate the usage of the TDC signals to formulate a event selection that prevents the analysis of pileup events.

\end{figure}
For each arm we take the RMS of the 64 time signal weighted by their charge.
Figure \ref{fig.dau200mb.bbctimetime} shows the rms distribution for both south (left) and north (right) arm. The top panels correspond to one of the d+Au dataset where a centrality selection of 0-5\% was applied.
As one can see the distributions are quite similar for the d-going and Au-going direction.
The distribution can be approximated to a Landau distribution and estimate its peak position and width.
The parameters of the fit are reported in the figures.
Notice that for dAu the mean of the fit does not vary much from south to north, however the sigma is quite different.

The bottom plot corresponds to the difference between the north and south estimation of time event-by-event , while the top plot corresponds to the RMS within the south arm. The blue distributions are for the variables before the coincidence cut. The red distributions are after the cut.}

The bottom plot is the depedence of the BBCsouth signal run by run to the total instantanoeus rate.}
